                    Sometimes, you might want an extra pair of eyes to look over your cover letter for that dream job. 
                    Or perhaps, you want a supercomputer to look over it instead.

                    Covfefe Letter, a hackathon project that was completed the weekend following <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/us/politics/covfefe-trump-twitter.html">an unfortunate tweet</a>, is an app that helps you write better cover letters. Users can write or copy and paste their draft into the editor, click “analyze”, and get feedback. The app also generates a word cloud based on keywords from the job description, so that the user can inlclude these in their letter. This app was among the top 5 best projects at the Mobile Monday API First Hackathon (June 2-4, 2017, NYC).              
                </p>

                <p>
                    The hackathon was sponsored by IBM, so we used Loopback as a server, and IBM Watson APIs (Tone Analysis and Natural Language Processing) to provide feedback.
